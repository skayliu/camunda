/**
 * This package is to isolate classes that will be part of the platform. This package is needed as
 * an intermediary step during engine abstraction refactoring to make the change easier. Attempts
 * were made to create a new Maven Module and start moving classes there. This did work well for the
 * sources, but not for the test sources. The test sources can best be refactored after the engine
 * abstraction was fully introduced.
